Russell WestBrook是MVP，我希望我在OKC，希望在主场看着RW，感受着那无与伦比的激情和专注。
每一次出手，对手的不可思议，澎湃的力量、宣泄的怒吼，摧毁着对手。与此同时，他还是一个场外型男，你永远都能看到他让人看不懂的着装，
你心里一定想着是：这家伙，想干嘛，如此的炫。最后一句，加油。
Russell WestBrook is MVP.I hope be part of OKC and watch him at home court,which experiences overwhelming passion with concentration.
With shooting the opponent appeared an unbelievable face、the surging power and the roar from RW.All those knock out the opponent.
Meanwhile,he is also a trendy man.You always see his bizarre dressing and realize wtf the guy, so cool.Last WestBrook fight to a finish.
